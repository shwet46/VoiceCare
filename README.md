## VoiceCare 

VoiceCare is a voice-first emergency support app for elderly users that passively listens for distress, speaks calmly during critical moments, guides users step by step, and automatically alerts caregivers or emergency services when needed—providing reassurance, safety, and continuous support until help arrives.
